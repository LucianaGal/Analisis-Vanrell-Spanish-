- Offer incentives for second purchases within 30 days of the first.

### 6. Use RFM Segmentation for Targeted Campaigns

- RFM analysis identified:
  - 8% VIP clients (high recency, frequency, and monetary value)
  - 12% potential loyal clients
  - 60% inactive or low-value clients

**Recommendations:**
- Tailored actions by segment:
  - VIP: early access to collections and exclusive benefits
  - At risk: reactivation campaigns and feedback surveys
  - New: onboarding emails and second-purchase incentives

### 7. Expand Based on Geographic Data

- Córdoba and Santa Fe lead in customer base and sales volume.
- Mendoza, Tucumán, and Buenos Aires show steady growth.

**Recommendations:**
- Use sales heat maps to identify hot and cold regions.
- Pilot express delivery, regional influencer campaigns, or mobile showrooms.
- Partner with local fashion boutiques for regional presence.

### 8. Improve Operational Data Collection for Better Decisions

Currently, the analysis is focused on commercial data, but operational insights are lacking.

**Recommendations:**
- Start recording **production and delivery times** to identify process bottlenecks.
- Capture **detailed cost of materials** per product category.
- Track **direct labor costs** by unit or batch.
- Implement internal dashboards combining operational and commercial KPIs.

These improvements will enable more precise analysis, including:
- Profitability by product line
- Production efficiency and optimization
- True ROI considering full cost structure
- Dynamic pricing and margin analysis
